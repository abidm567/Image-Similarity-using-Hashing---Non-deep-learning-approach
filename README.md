# Image-Similarity-using-Hashing---Non-deep-learning-approach
Image hashing (or image fingerprinting) is a technique that is used to convert an image to an alphanumeric string. It lets you detect identical or visually similar images based on the hamming distance and threshold we set.
As the hashes are small and text-based strings, this non- deep learning approach can be stored without taking up lots of storage space and they can be searched swiftly.
There are many image hashing algorithms, some of the most popular algorithms are: 
i) Average Hashing (aHash) 
ii) Median Hashing (mHash) 
iii) Perceptual Hashing (pHash) 
iv) Difference Hashing (dHash) 
v) Wavelet Hashing (wHash) 
vi) ColorMoment Hashing
In this project I've compared the results from the Average hashing, Phash and dhash techniques to detect if the uploaded image is a duplicate image or not.

The use cases for this technique can be in 
a) Marketing - To suggest visually similart products to the user ot to detect if the sellers are using duplicate images of other products listed on the website.
b) Fraud detection in warranty claims by using reverse image search
